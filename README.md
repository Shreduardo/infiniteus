Throughout college, I worked at a juice bar on the west side of Chicago. The projects contained in here were created to help analyze the operations behind the kitchen.

The work this did gave us helpful insight into how we can optimize the operations of the kitchen and led to full scale operations and menu change. Sadly, the cost calculator for the products got overwritten somehow. 
However, because of how helpful this was to the business, I plan on fixing things up and re-creating that calculator.
